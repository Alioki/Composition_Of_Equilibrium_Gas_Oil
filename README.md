# Project Title

Estimate composition of equilibrium gas oil in given pressure and temperature

## Description
Determining the proportions of gas and liquid in hydrocarbon reservoirs is essential for optimizing field production. Understanding the phase composition of each component in gas and liquid phases enables engineers to develop better strategies for production, management, and maintenance of hydrocarbon fields. One common method for estimating this composition is by using the K-factor, derived from the Peng-Robinson equation of state and fugacity coefficient calculations. Combined with flash calculations, this approach provides the equilibrium conditions between gas and liquid phases for specific mixtures, allowing precise determination of phase composition.

In this study, we examined a mixture containing three components—methane (CH₄), normal butane (n-C₄), and normal decane (n-C₁₀)—with molar fractions of 0.5301 for methane, 0.1055 for n-C₄, and 0.3644 for n-C₁₀. At a pressure of 1000 psi and temperature of 210°F, we employed flash calculations to determine the phase composition of each component in both the gas and liquid phases. Additionally, we accounted for binary interaction coefficients, setting values of 0.02 for methane-n-butane, 0.04 for methane-n-decane, and 0 for n-butane-n-decane. These coefficients are critical for accurately representing the non-ideal interactions between components in the Peng-Robinson model.

## Methodology

## Applications


This method, demonstrated through a simplified example, can be extended to more complex hydrocarbon mixtures containing various components. By utilizing the same approach with the **K-factor** calculations, along with **Peng-Robinson equation of state**, **fugacity coefficients**, and **flash calculations**, it is possible to accurately determine the phase composition of multiple components in a mixture. For each component, required parameters include the **mole fraction**, **critical temperature** and **pressure**, **acentric factor**, and **vapor pressure**. This enables accurate modeling of phase behavior in reservoirs, which is critical for optimizing production processes. The capability to calculate gas and liquid compositions under various conditions makes this approach highly applicable in reservoir simulations, facility design, and overall resource management in hydrocarbon fields.
